            In the summer of 2005, my wife Dottie and I visited Kenya for the first time. We met Dr. Hal Burtchel and his wife 
            Ruthann who managed a Christian ministry in the Nairobi slums to residents who face extreme poverty due to massive 
            unemployment. (Unemployment in these slums is approximately 80%.) Living conditions there are as bad as any in the world. 
            <p>                
            We worked in Kebira and Kawangware, the two major slums in Nairobi. There, we met a young Kenya Baptist pastor, Meshack Chitiavi, 
            and his wife, Beatrice. At that time, their family included a young son, Barnabas. Since then, their family has grown to include 
            a daughter, Sharron. 
            <p>
            Since 2005, we returned to Kenya over twenty times. Unfortunately, in 2013, Meshack lost his life due to cancer. Before his death, 
            Dottie and I promised to support Beatrice and see that educational needs for Barnabas and Sharron would be provided, which has 
            continued since then. On June 1, 2019, cancer claimed the life of my wife Dottie. At that point, our family, Stacy, Sandy, Jeff, 
            and Susan, all discussed the formation of the Dottie Shealy Ministry Foundation to fund educational opportunities for deserving 
            Kenyan students in addition to Barnabas and Sharron. It was such a God thing, and 501C-3 status was obtained. 
            <p>
            At this point, in addition to assisting Beatrice with school expenses in Kenya, the foundation has assisted a Kenyan pastor with 
            education expenses as he has continued his education in North Carolina, and a pre -med medical student at Mount Olive University 
            in North Carolina. This student has since graduated from Mount Olive University and is preparing to continue his medical education, 
            possibly at Duke University.  
            <p>
            At a church youth camp several years ago, Dottie acquired the name "Hot Dot" from the kids. This nickname has stuck with her. 
            <p>
            The 1st annual "Hot Dot Trot" fundraiser is intended to help enable the Foundation to provide resources to continue this work. We 
            certainly appreciate the opportunity to partner with the Wilkes Pregnancy Care Center for this event. Dottie worked at the center 
            for several years, and this cause was dear to her heart. 
            <p>
            Thank you for helping the Wilkes Pregnancy Care Center and the Dottie Shealy Ministry Foundation as we continue with this work.

            A Note from Psalms:
            </h1>
        
        <div id="topher" style="text-align: justify;width:680px">
            Growing up, I witnessed the impact of poverty and healthcare challenges within my community. Relatives selling assets to cover 
            healthcare costs highlighted the need for improvement. My personal experience further underscored the inadequacies of the 
            healthcare system.
            <p>
            Inspired by these events, I pursued Clinical Medicine and Surgery training as a Physician Assistant. After graduation, I 
            worked with faith-based communities, delivering Primary Health Care. Post-graduation, I felt compelled to bridge the gap 
            between providers, policymakers, and faith-based organizations. These organizations had the integrity and trust of the 
            communities they served.
            <p>
            I pursued an opportunity to add to my skills and expertise by pursuing a role as a Global Health Practitioner, which I am 
            currently in the process of.
            <p>
            I propose data-driven, innovative programs that enhance Primary Health Care access for underserved communities. Embracing 
            science-based approaches and research, I seek to extend hope and care to underserved communities. My vision is to champion 
            Healthcare for all individuals, whether in Kenya (my home) or Raleigh, North Carolina (where I currently live and work with 
            my wife and daughter). In other words, I am a disciple of Jesus who uses my influence in health and wellness to advocate             
            for needy communities.
